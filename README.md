# Advent of Code 2020
This is a repository of my attempts to solve each of the two daily puzzles in the AOC 2020 challenge at www.adventofcode.com

I work in PHP so that's the language I'm using, so sue me ;)

## Disclaimer
The code in this repository is just for fun, if you decide to crib from bits of it for anything serious and it goes wrong, that's on you.

I've also included reproductions of the instructions/puzzle text for each day from the AOC website, just to give context to each bit of code and save me having to go back to the website, but that content belongs to the guys behind AOC - not me. Hopefully they won't object to me copying it here.
